## Conway's Game of Life
My application allows users to 'play' Conway's Game of Life.  Users can place cells, set the size of the grid, set the evolution speed, evolve one step at a time, stop the evolutions, clear the board, and change the parameters of the game.  Users can use the application to learn about Conway's and experiment with different rules.

Challenges:
Conway's algorithm
Drawing a grid
Resizing grid dynamically
avoiding reference type vs value type issues :(
Tweakpane (Couldn't figure out moving the pane, gave up)
Hooking up UI controls to the corresponding features correctly
